# Information & Signals

Most important task of DSP is understanding how information contained in signals that you're working:

* Time-Domain Information
* Freq.-Domain Information

#### Time Domain Information

**BASIC:** Amplitude of signal

Step-Function is used for time-domain parameters

#### Frequency Domain Information

**BASIC**: System's motion, relationship between samples

Freq-Response is used for freq-domain parameters.

#### Time vs Freq. Domain

Example:

* EKG Device: Signal shape, amplitude important --> Time-Domain, Step-Response
* Hearing Aid Device: Signal frequency is important --> Freq-Domain, Freq-Response
