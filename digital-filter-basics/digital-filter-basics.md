# Digital Filter Basics

#### DIGITAL FILTER TYPES

* **FIR**: Convolution-Based
* **IIR**: Recursive-Based

Every linear filter have common responses:

* IMPULSE
* STEP
* FREQUENCY

#### Impulse Response

TO-DO

#### Step Response

Integral of the Impulse Response

**Calculation**

* Method-1: Apply Step Input
* Method-2: Integrate Impulse Responses (Running-Sum)

#### Frequency Response

**Calculation**

* DFT (or FFT)

**Freq. Response can be used:**

* Linear Scale: To demonstrate Pass-Band Ripple & Roll-off&#x20;
* Logarithmic Scale: Stop Band Attenuation
